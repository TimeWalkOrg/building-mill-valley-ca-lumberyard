## Building History
Throughout its hundred and twenty six years of existence the Mill Valley Lumber Yard has gone though a number of names and owners. First owned privately in 1892, the yard opened with the name Dollar Lumber Co under the ownership of Robert Dollar. Six years later in 1898 the yard was transferred into the ownership of J.H.McInnes, who kept the yard for ten years. In 1908 it was sold to R.C. Doherty, who reopened it under the name Doherty Lumber Co. Doherty owned the yard for  four years before it changed ownership once again in 1912 to N.P. Yost and gained its current name: Mill Valley Lumber Co. Since 1912 the yard has move through several other peopleâ€™s hands (1956 - J.L. Castleman; 1988 - J.L. Castleman et. al. J. Merchant; 1996 - J.Merchant; 2004 - T. Cerri; 2012 - Matt and Jan Mathews) but has retained the name Mill Valley Lumber Co. The yard was remodeled in 1914 following significant damage in a storm, but retains the same building footprints.


Excerpt from a 2014 historic evaluation ([link here](http://cityofmillvalley.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=721&meta_id=31010)):

"The history of the Mill Valley Lumber property is integral to the history of the town of Mill Valley. 
Founded concurrent with the late-19th century origins of the town and located along one of Mill Valley's
two principal thoroughfares, the MVL site and its use have been familiar to generations of local
residents. The MVL is one of MV's oldest, largest and most durable commercial properties and
businesses. Even if most may never have entered the property, it is a longstanding commercial
landmark along Miller Avenue, signifying an aspect of the early and ongoing commercial character
of Mill Valley, including the connection between the town and its region to the 19th century
lumber trade. Moreover, the MVL property is integrally associated both with Corte Madera
Creek and with the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, the courses of which were manifest in the
original and early form of the property and its structures."
